While ago I wrote, just for fun, bunch of greenish blue (!) balls bouncing around in a "box" - nothing more than a div. Actually, not a canvas or svg animation, just plain JavaScript DOM manupulation. They bounce and also pulse, and it's amazing how today's DOM trickery is running quite smooth :)
See it in action [here][1]

You coan enter number of balls you wish to bounce around, and play with offset parameter. Click generate to start the show.

Code itself is not a rocket science, you can see it [here][2]
