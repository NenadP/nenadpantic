I am full-stack developer interested in full application lifecycle. At the moment I work with **Java / Spring** based backend technologies and **ES6 / Angular** front-end.

I enjoy creating things and I am curiously exploring innovations and continuing to upgrade my knowledge.

Getting the job done is always my first priority.
